kcp-operator is a Kubernetes operator to deploy and run [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp) instances on a Kubernetes cluster. kcp is a horizontally scalable control plane for Kubernetes-like APIs.

## Features

- [x] Create and update core components of a kcp setup (root shard, additional shards, front proxy)
- [x] Support for multi-shard deployments of kcp
- [ ] Support for a dedicated cache-server deployment not embedded in the root shard
- [x] Generate and refresh kubeconfigs for accessing kcp instances or specific shards
- [ ] Cross-namespace/-cluster setups of a multi-shard kcp deployment

## Support Matrix

The table below marks known support of a kcp version in kcp-operator versions.

<!-- The same table is in docs/content/README.md, make sure to keep them in-sync. -->

| kcp    | `main`             | 0.8.x              | 0.7.x              | 0.6.x              |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |

[^1]: While we try to support kcp's `main` branch, this support is best effort and should not be used for deploying actual kcp instances.

## Feature Gates

kcp-operator supports Kubernetes-style feature gates to enable or disable experimental features. Feature gates can be configured using the `--feature-gates` flag when starting the operator.

### Available Feature Gates

There are currently no feature gates defined.

### Usage

Enable feature gates when starting the operator:

```bash
# Enable a single feature
./operator --feature-gates=SomeFeature=true

# Enable multiple features
./operator --feature-gates=SomeFeature=true,AnotherFeature=true
```
