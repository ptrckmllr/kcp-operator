!!! warning
    While kcp-operator is usable, the project is still in an early state. Please only use it if you know what you are doing. We recommend against using it in production setups right now.

kcp-operator is a Kubernetes operator to deploy and run [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp) instances on a Kubernetes cluster. kcp is a horizontally scalable control plane for Kubernetes-like APIs.

## Features

- Create and update core components of a kcp setup (root shard, additional shards, front proxy)
- Support for multi-shard deployments of kcp
- Generate and refresh kubeconfigs for accessing kcp instances or specific shards

## Support Matrix

The table below marks known support of a kcp version in kcp-operator versions.

<!-- The same table is in the global README.md, make sure to keep them in-sync. -->

| kcp    | `main`             | 0.8.x              | 0.7.x              | 0.6.x              |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `main` | :warning:          | :question:         | :question:         | :question:         |
| 0.32.x | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :question:         | :question:         |
| 0.31.x | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.30.x | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.29.x | :question:         | :question:         | :question:         | :question:         |

*Explanation*:

- :white_check_mark:: This combination is actively tested in CI and is supported.
- :warning:: While we try to support kcp's `main` branch, this support is best effort and should not be used for deploying actual kcp instances.
- :question:: While this *could* work, it is not actively validated by CI pipelines. Support for it is limited.
